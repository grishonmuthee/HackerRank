To convert the alculator app into a Linux GUI application, you'll follow similar steps as for any other GUI application on Linux.

Terminal:
Install Tkinter
	sudo apt-get install python3-tk
At the top of your Python script, add a shebang line that points to your Python interpreter. Since you're using Python 3, this would look like
	#!/usr/bin/env python3
Terminal:
	chmod +x your_calculator_script.py
	./your_calculator_script.py
Create a Desktop Entry
	touch calculator.desktop
Open the file using a text editor and add the following content:
	[Desktop Entry]
	Name=Simple Calculator
	Exec=/path/to/your_calculator_script.py
	Icon=/path/to/calculator-icon.png
	Type=Application
	Terminal=false
Terminal:
	chmod +x calculator.desktop
	mv calculator.desktop ~/.local/share/applications

After completing the steps above, you should be able to find your calculator app in the applications menu on your Linux desktop environment.
